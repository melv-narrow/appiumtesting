# 📱 My Appium Test Automation Journey

> *"Every expert was once a beginner"* - Learning and growing with mobile test automation

## 🚀 About This Project

Welcome to my Appium test automation learning repository! This project represents my journey into the world of mobile app testing, where I'm building a robust test automation framework using:

- ☕ Java
- 🤖 Appium
- 📊 TestNG
- 🏗️ Maven
- 📝 Allure Reports

## 🎯 What I'm Learning

### Mobile Testing Concepts
- Native Android/iOS app testing
- Mobile web browser testing
- Gestures (swipe, scroll, long press)
- Alert handling
- Mobile elements interaction

### Test Framework Features
- Page Object Model implementation
- Cross-platform test execution
- Data-driven testing with TestNG
- Beautiful test reports with Allure
- Efficient test base setup
